                <h2>Martin's Tank Care Tips</h2>
                <ul class="care__tips">
                    <li>Cycle the Tank Before Adding Fish</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cycling a tank means to take the steps necessary to bring the water conditions up to where
                            they are healthy for the fish</li>
                        <li>Never attempt to cycle your tank with fish already in it</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Test and Monitor Water Parameters</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ammonia, nitrates, and nitrites are fine at low levels but left unchecked they can build up
                            to unhealthy amounts</li>
                        <li>Test the pH of your water, if the water is very hard bring the pH down with chemicals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Perform Regular Water Changes</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Changing water frequently is better than adding chemicals</li>
                        <li>Remove about one-third of the water from your tank every week and replace it with fresh,
                            clean water</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Research Fish Before Purchasing</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It’s a beginner’s mistake to go to the pet store and purchase fish by looks alone</li>
                        <li>Do not overstock your tank</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Avoid Overfeeding Your Fish</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is very difficult to starve a fish; one feeding per day is plenty</li>
                        <li>Do not feed more than the fish will eat in a few minutes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Manage Light in and Around Your Aquarium</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Too much light will result in uncontrolled algae growth</li>
                        <li>You should keep the tank light on a maximum of 12 hours every day, but less is better</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
